[Piwik](https://piwik.org) analytics component for [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)


## Installation

	npm install piwik-react-router --save


## Features

- asynchronous loading of Piwik
- javascript error tracking


## Usage

Simply create your instance with the same `url` and `siteId` as described in the piwik [documentation](https://developer.piwik.org/guides/tracking-javascript-guide) and connect it to your `history` object.

_Starting with v2.0 react-router won't provide a default history. [Why?](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/upgrade-guides/v2.0.0.md#no-default-history)_.

```jsx
var PiwikReactRouter = require('piwik-react-router');

var piwik = PiwikReactRouter({
	url			: 'your-piwik-installation.com',
	siteId		: 1
});

<Router history={piwik.connectToHistory(history)}>
	<Route path="/" component={MyComponent} />
</Router>
```

If you're using react-router prior to v1.0 please head over to the [react-router0.13.x branch](https://github.com/joernroeder/piwik-react-router/tree/react-router0.13.x).

For the url-option you can also include `http://` or `https://` in the beginning of the url, if you piwik installation is on ssl, but your react-site is not, or visa versa.


## Options

### enableLinkTracking: `true`

[Link tracking](http://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/tracking-javascript#using-the-tracker-object) to track outgoing and download links is enabled by default.


### updateDocumentTitle: `true`

Updates the document title before adding a new page view as the title may changed during the route rendering. Make sure you call `piwik.track` __after__ React has rendered the `<Handler />` to make this work correctly.  
If you don't know how to update the title, check out the great [react-document-title](https://github.com/gaearon/react-document-title) module.


### trackErrors: `false`

By enabling this option occurring javascript errors will be tracked as a `JavaScript Error` piwik event.

## API

### track (Location location)

Adds a page view from a history [Location](https://github.com/rackt/history/blob/master/docs/Location.md) if the `path` changed.

`path = location.pathname + location.search`


### push (args)

Pushes the specified args to the Piwik tracker the same way as you're using the `_paq.push(args);` directly. You can use this method as the low-level api to call methods from the [Piwik API](http://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/tracking-javascript#list-of-all-methods-available-in-the-tracking-api), [track events](http://piwik.org/docs/event-tracking/#tracking-events) or call [custom functions](http://developer.piwik.org/guides/tracking-javascript-guide).


### trackError (error, [eventName])

Tracks the given error as a new [Piwik Event](http://piwik.org/docs/event-tracking/#tracking-events) for the given event name. If you don't specify any name here it will fallback to `JavaScript Error`.


### connectToHistory(history)

Adds a listener to the passed in `history` and triggers `track(location)` whenever the history changes.


### disconnectFromHistory()

Disconnects Piwik from a previous connected history. Returns whether it could successfully disconnect.


## A note on serverside rendering

Piwik tracking is disabled for serverside rendering and all API methods are replaced with noop-functions so you don't have to worry about it.
